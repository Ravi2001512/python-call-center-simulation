About the Project 

This Python program simulates a call center system using the SimPy library. 
It models how incoming customer calls are handled by a limited number of agents and 
measures the performance of the system under different staffing levels.

How to Run 

1. Install Python and SimPy 
Make sure Python is installed on your computer.

Then install SimPy by running:

Pip install simply 

2. Save and Run the Code

Save the simulation code as call_center_simulation.py 

Then open a terminal or command prompt and run: 

python call_center_simulation.py 

3. Enter Number of Agents
   
The program will ask how many agents are available. 

Example â€“  

Enter number of agents: 5 

4. View Results 

After running, the simulation will display results like: 

Results for 5 Agents: 

Average Wait (min): 2.36 

Average Queue Length: 1.12 

Throughput (calls/min): 0.50 

Utilization: 0.770 

Total Calls Arrived: 240
